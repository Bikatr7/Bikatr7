### Hello!

My name is Bikatr7, I'm currently juggling school, work and my major projects at the moment: [Kudasai](https://github.com/Bikatr7/Kudasai)

Kudasai is a Japanese-English preprocessor with automated translation capabilities using OpenAI and DeepL APIs, operable via CLI, WebGUI, or Console. 

Currently furthering my interests in Japanese and NLP

Always looking for help on a project, feel free to email me at [Tetralon07@gmail.com](mailto:Tetralon07@gmail.com) about anything!
