### Hello!

My name is Bikatr7, I'm currently juggling school, work and two major projects of mine at the moment: [Seisen](https://github.com/Bikatr7/Seisen) and [Kudasai](https://github.com/Bikatr7/Kudasai)

Kudasai is a Japanese-English preprocessor with automated translation capabilities using OpenAI and DeepL APIs, operable via CLI, WebGUI, or Console. 

And Seisen is my custom Japanese trainer that I'm still heavily working on!

Currently furthering my interests in Japanese and NLP

Always looking for help on a project, feel free to email me at [Tetralon07@gmail.com](mailto:Tetralon07@gmail.com) about anything!
