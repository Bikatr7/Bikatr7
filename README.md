### Hello! 👋

I'm Bikatr7, a rising junior majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Japanese. My work primarily focuses on Japanese-related projects, exploring applications in NER/NLP, AI, and large language models (LLM) within software development.

📚 **Currently prepping for finals and juggling a handful of personal projects:**

- **[EasyTL](https://github.com/Bikatr7/EasyTL)**: A package providing seamless multi-API translation, simplifying language barriers with DeepL, OpenAI, and Gemini.
- **[Kudasai](https://github.com/Bikatr7/Kudasai)**: Streamlining Japanese-English translation through advanced preprocessing and integrated translation technologies.
- **[Kakusui.org](https://kakusui.org)**: Homepage under development for Kakusui and related projects. [Source code available here](https://github.com/Kakusui/kakusui-org).

📫 **Feel free to contact me!**  
Email me at [Tetralon07@gmail.com](mailto:Tetralon07@gmail.com) about programming, potential projects, or just to chat!
